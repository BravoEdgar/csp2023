    <p id="cse">The reason I took CSE and why I recommend it for others is because, in CSE you are able to create many different things involving computers. In todays advancing age computers are everything and learning about them is, in my opinion, important. With this world full of technology people who know their way around comupters are going to become very important.</p>

<p>Some things that I enjoy to do in my time is play music. Not only listening to music but also creating music with instruments. I play the <a href="cb.html">contrabass</a> as well as <a href="electric.html">electric bass</a>. I also find great pleasure in cleaning up spaces. Ogranizing things and making sure things have a spot is nice to me. </p>
