  <h2>Acheivements</h2>
  <P>I have achieved many things in my life. One big thing that I am the most proud of in my programming life is my take on Ellsworth Kelly's Spectrum V. Abstract art that is followed with intense colors and shapes. It was my first project I made when starting my programming career. I made this by using points that I learned from my CSE class mainly using CSS and HTML. Here is a link to that <a href="SpectrumV.html">file</a>.</p>
